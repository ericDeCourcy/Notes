# 2018 TW200 Maintenance Notes

_Please note that I'm not a mechanic. I'm just some dude who likes to learn by doing._

## Carburetor

### Pilot screw
- The pilot screw is accessible on the outside of the carb, and meters idle fuel flow especially when the throttle is closed. Basically there's a hole in the main carb tube, right next to the engine intake manifold. The screw, when tightened, closes fuel flow and restricts it. When loosened, it opens fuel flow. I found that tightening the pilot screw helped when the bike was running too rich, it seemed like i was having issues combusting fuel. I deduced it was running rich by see particulates in the exhaust (AKA, "seeing" the exhaust), and by seeing that the bike died when the choke was pulled.  

### Personal observations
- The part where the carb connects to the airbox is flexible rubber, so the carb can be pushed into that to get the clearance to pull it out from the engine manifold
- There's two types of carb on tw's - this is the "new" carb AKA the "TK" carb. You can see it's a TK carb because the metal has a "TK" in a little circle cast into the side of the carburetor.
- The rubber cap listed as Part #21 on [this diagram](https://www.partzilla.com/catalog/yamaha/motorcycle/2002/tw200-tw200p/carburetor?srsltid=AfmBOoop6BhYQeMbGHnHbGZOtflfhl0IWDYpsGGKwjBsGbvhu9dlZEOr) is apparently needed to allow the carb to function.
- The nozzle is a little aluminum piece that fell out on me while cleaning the carb. It is important and goes in a specific direction. [Here's a thread discussing it](https://www.tw200forum.com/threads/carburetor-nozzle-above-main-jet.68446/).
- Carb cleaner is apparently mostly acetone. It'll melt the fuck out of rubber components, like gaskets and stuff. I wonder if just using regular acetone would do the trick, but the ability to spray with a tube is really nice for getting into nooks and crannies.
- The main gasket (Part #26 on [this diagram](https://www.partzilla.com/catalog/yamaha/motorcycle/2002/tw200-tw200p/carburetor?srsltid=AfmBOoop6BhYQeMbGHnHbGZOtflfhl0IWDYpsGGKwjBsGbvhu9dlZEOr)) should be replaced with the ridge facing up, towards the body of the carb and not towards the float bowl.
- I really really wish i had a tiny hook tool to get the gasket from the pilot screw out of its hole. Holy crap, DO NOT use carb cleaner til you get that gasket out. It will make a giant mess in a very hard to access place.
- You'll need something very narrow to clean the various holes in the carb jets. I used a piece of stranded copper wire, cutting off strands until the wire was small enough to fit in the holes. Other folks have suggested using a high E guitar string.
- The screws are JIS screws. Slightly different than Philips head screws. Apparently you're less likely to strip these tiny screws if you use a JIS bit. [Read about the differences here](https://daitool.com/blogs/news/phillips-head-vs-jis-screwdriver-japanese-industrial-standard-screwdrivers?srsltid=AfmBOorsD4-jTLMtJqWv1La45mxdXCJmpPWTL9fakPbLCGdC23XIfl2Z)
- The "emulsion tube" or "emulsifier tube" is really just the main nozzle "bleed" or the entire assembly between the main jet and the nozzle.
- The choke cuts off airflow. This is for easier starting of the bike, where less air is needed vs fuel.
  - Imagine you're getting "choked". Choking == no air. 

## Spark Plug

- [Spark plug is NGK **DR8EA**](https://www.tw200forum.com/threads/spark-plug.17242/)
- Spark plug gap appears to be `0.024-0.028 inches` or `0.6-0.7 mm`. [Manual page](https://www.tw200forum.com/threads/sparkplug-gap.18946/) and [forum discussion](https://www.tw200forum.com/threads/sparkplug-gap.18946/) seem to agree
