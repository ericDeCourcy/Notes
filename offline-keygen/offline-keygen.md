# Offline Keygen

This is a project about securely generating private keys or seed phrases offline, with the end goal being a system that can be used to generate paper wallets, which is usable by anyone with basic consumer hardware and basic technical skills. There will also be a component for this which is dividing up keys into secret shares for secure storage across many different physical locations.

## Goals

- user friendly
  - human-readable for low-error
  - basic hardware requirements
  - basic technical concepts
- secret shares
  - Easy to divide up keys into N-of-M style shares
