Lets figure out what a perfect world looks like

## Story Time 

I've asked the questions "what does a perfect world look like?" and "how does a perfect world differ from our own?" a few times. My goal is to better understand how we make our world perfect. Its a complicated question because it's so subjective and often adversarial. 

The answers i can recall are grouped into two types:
- "The world would better with more empathy and understanding" - Two of 3 respondants so far have said something like this. Salient points are that people's feelings are being manipulated and sadness/anger stems from misunderstanding. Love is a positive-sum game. Most people just want to be loved and understood, and we can provide that
- "The world would be better if people didn't lie" - This is the 3rd response, and is very similar to the first but in a more direct way. It is different from the first response in that it presumes that people will not understand each other indirectly. But still, it shares the theme that sadness/anger comes from misunderstanding. A salient point is that people need to trust each other to plan for the future.  

Its interesting to see that of 3 people i've directly asked about this, each answer seems to have throughlines of trust and love. Most things mentioned have to do with interpersonal, "micro" relationships, rather than macro things like geopolitics.

A sample size of 3 is not enough. I will collect more data.
