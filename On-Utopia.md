## What

Lets figure out what a perfect world looks like

## Wisdom of the crowd

I've asked the questions "what does a perfect world look like?" and "how does a perfect world differ from our own?" a few times. My goal is to better understand how we make our world perfect. Its a complicated question because it's so subjective and often adversarial. 

The answers i can recall are grouped into two types:
- "The world would better with more empathy and understanding" - Two of 3 respondants so far have said something like this. Salient points are that people's feelings are being manipulated and sadness/anger stems from misunderstanding. Love is a positive-sum game. Most people just want to be loved and understood, and we can provide that
- "The world would be better if people didn't lie" - This is the 3rd response, and is very similar to the first but in a more direct way. It is different from the first response in that it presumes that people will not understand each other indirectly. But still, it shares the theme that sadness/anger comes from misunderstanding. A salient point is that people need to trust each other to plan for the future.  

Its interesting to see that of 3 people i've directly asked about this, each answer seems to have throughlines of trust and love. Most things mentioned have to do with interpersonal, "micro" relationships, rather than macro things like geopolitics.

A sample size of 3 is not enough. I will collect more data.

## Concepts
### Cooperation versus Competition

A general principle of the modern (capitalist) world is competition. The strong survive, the weak perish. This is mirrored in the natural world - we see the concept of "survival of the fittest". But does it have to be that way? I would imagine most people agree that not having to compete with everyone else around them in order to survive would be kinda nice. 

We can see that there are many projects which achieve better outcomes with cooperation than they would have with an individualist, competitive nature. Which makes sense, in many ways. For example, attempting to develop the "best" product on the market, in a competitive environment, means expending resources protecting intellectual property, attacking other competitors, and of course research and devlopment (which is more costly because competitors will not share IP, resulting in having to reinvent things multiple times over, once for each firm). Instead of wasting resources on redundant research, and on maintaining an aggressive front against competitors, if all particpants collaborated, we could acheive the same "best" product much faster and with less labor. Isn't that good?

The quickest answer to the question of why we compete seems to be "thats how evolution/the natural world works". But, are we not better than that? Fairness is ingrained in human psychology, and we create laws to discourage wanton murder and rape, which also occur in the natural world. We create social programs so the disabled can survive. We have a natural desire to be better than animals in the jungle. 

## Open questions
- [ ] What is stopping us from cooperating rather than competing? (in the sense that capitalism encourages competition)
