# Resources

This should just be a list of good resources

## Crypto things
### Solidity/ETH stuff
- https://www.4byte.directory/ - database of function selectors
- https://ethtx.info/ - decode mainnet ETH transactions

### Crosschain and bridging
- https://routescan.io/ - compiles many different chains and lets them be searchable. Even shows cross-chain transactions
- https://www.metis.io/bridge#bridge - there are lots of 3rd party bridges listed here for use with Metis. Just a good resource for finding bridge options

## Programmer things
### Markdown/Github
- [mermaid diagrams](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/)
